      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Lisa is based out of Denver, Co. She spent her early days on Maui, Hi.
        She has a bachelor's degree in business entrepreneurship and management
        and associates in culinary. She is currently a UX/UI student at Lambda
        school.<br />
        Lisa was a business owner of a Crossfit gym in Denver, Co and a chef
        from coast to coast. She is a natural team player and values
        collaboration but a workhorse on solo projects.<br />
        She has always felt happy in her career and achieved everything she
        wanted from it but wanted more. She has a desire for growth and
        expansion regardless of temporary discomfort. She’s comfortable with
        being uncomfortable.<br />
        Curiosity in design brought her into this new passion. An area for
        growth and a display of her creativity and love for new challenges.<br />
        Outside of design, Lisa is a Crossfit and a nutrition coach. She finds
        inspiration in helping others reach their goals. She’s always finding
        new ways to be better, a better designer, a better friend, a better
        person.
